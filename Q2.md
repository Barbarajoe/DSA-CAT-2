# **Arrays**
  + Memory allocation -:
     1. `Contiguous Memory - Arrays store elements in contiguous memory location. `
     2. `Static Allocation - Arrays are statically allocated. `
     3. `Memory Overhead - Arrays can have memory overhead if the overhead if the allocated size is much larger than the actual number of a elements used`

  + Performance -:
    1.  `Fast Access -  O(1) for random access via index `
    2.  `Cache Efficiency - High cache locality due to contiguous memory, reducing cache misses. `

  + Insertion and deletion operations -:  
     1.  `Insertion - O(1) at the end (if space exists), O(n) if shifting elements is needed.`
     2.  `Deletion - O(n) if elements need shifting.`

# **LinkedLists**
  + Memory allocation -: 
     1.  `Non-Contiguous Memory - linked lists store elements in non-contiguous memory locations.`
     2.  `Dynamic Allocation:** Linked lists are dynamically allocated.`
     3.   `Memory Overhead:** Linked lists have memory overhead due to the storage of pointers in each node.`

  + Performance -: 
     1. ` Sequential Access: Linked lists provide sequential access. `
     2. `Cache Effiency - Due to non-contiguous memory allocation, linked lists are less cache-friendly.`

  + Insertion and deletion operations -:  
     1. `Insertion: O(1) at the head or tail (if pointer is maintained).`
     2.  ` Deletion: O(1) if the node reference is given; O(n) if searching is needed. `
